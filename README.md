This repo documents the setup, configuration, and experiments Iâ€™m conducting to develop hands-on skills in offensive and defensive security, system hardening, and GRC practices.

The goal of this project is to:
- Build a functional homelab on a single laptop
- Explore different areas of cybersecurity through real tools and scenarios
- Document the process and progress as a portfolio

## Lab Setup

| Component       | Details                                 |
|----------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Laptop**       | ThinkPad T480 (i5 8th Gen, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD) |
| **Host OS**      | Debian 12 (Stable)                     |
| **Hypervisor**   | QEMU + KVM                             |
| **VMs**          | Kali Linux, Metasploitable 2, Ubuntu Server, Windows 10, Security Onion |

## Focus

I'm currently exploring several areas within cybersecurity to find my niche:

- **Offensive Security:** Vulnerability scanning, exploitation, and red teaming tools  
- **Defensive Security:** Log analysis, detection engineering, and SIEM use  
- **System Hardening:** Secure Linux and Windows configurations

## Screenshots & Diagrams

Visual documentation of:
- Nmap scans, Burp Suite output, Metasploit use
- Security Onion dashboards
- Exploits, alerts, and hardening logs

## Next Steps

- [x] Configure core VMs (Kali, Metasploitable, Ubuntu Server)
- [ ] Deploy DVWA on Ubuntu Server
- [ ] Integrate Security Onion for defensive testing
- [ ] Start tracking TryHackMe/HTB challenge completions
- [ ] Expand documentation and add automation scripts
- [ ] Upgrade computer hardware i.e RAM, SSD (Since the T480 is a bit modular)
